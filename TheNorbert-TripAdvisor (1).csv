We chose The Norbert because it had many options that were gluten free, this is a struggle at many restaurants . But it is clear at The Norbert the chefs understand that you should let a foods natural flavors come through and not cover them by dredging the food in flour. They offer up WI classics like cheescurds and fried chicken in a delicate coating of flour alternatives to still give you the classic food but keep it fresh and light.  The flavor profiles of everything was of the charts.  We had the cheese curds, brussel sprouts, fried chicken and steak tacos and EVERYTHING was amazing.  The waitstaff is friendly and responsive to your needs.  The owner is clear and present and working his tail off to make your experience the best! As we were preparing to leave, it was pouring rain, the owner thought he had some umbrellas stashed and stopped us to go looking for them. While he couldn't find them, the offer and time he spent to do this was very much appreciated.  Then his staff suggested we come back in for some dessert. We said there was nothing gluten free in desserts and we were told, well, we may have something for you.  The amazing chef, I think his name was Jay, made us an Australian Pavlova.  Again, it had the most amazing flavor profile and texture variation, of any dessert we have ever had.  West Bend has a hidden gem among it, The Norbert is a must stop for everyone, but make sure you leave us a table, because we will be back!","Written August 1, 2024"

We loved everything we ate. The flavors are explosive and there is nothing like this place in the area. Staff is professional, well dressed and friendly. The restaurant and kitchen are very clean as are the bathrooms. You can tell the owner and employees take great pride in this establishment!","Written January 16, 2024"

It was getting late so we decided to have dinner in West Bend at The Norbert, and were glad we did. You don’t have to travel to Milwaukee for fine dining, wonderful drinks and impeccable friendly service.","Written December 23, 2023"

The best thing going in town in my opinion.  Creative menu items.  Fantastic bar staff.  A fabulous place to hang out.  Newly remodeled.  Really nice!  
Only drawback... no more musical entertainment.  Many of us in town miss that.  :(","Written November 14, 2023"

Positive reviews are spot on. Wife is still trying to figure out why her Cosmo was so good. We tried 3 apps and 4 dishes and wish we had tried more. Everything was excellent except the desert we ordered to go, could use a little more creativity on those options or maybe we were just to full :)","Written April 16, 2023"

From the Sour Cherry Old Fashioned to all of the wonderful tapas and the nice musician playing in the background.  Highly recommend the Melon Salad, Pear and Brie Flatbread as well as the Coconut Shrimp.  You won't be disappointed.  Service was outstanding as well.","Written June 24, 2022"

As we wondered throughout town we asked several people for a dinner restaurant recommendation.  Three different people suggested this place.  It did not disappoint! The food, service and atmosphere were fabulous.  Small plates with huge flavor!  We loved the  goat cheese appetizer, brisket bruschetta and Buttermilk Chicken; all shareable.  The food was more than 2 people could share.   We look forward to coming back on our next trip through West Bend.  This is a destination place.","Written February 1, 2022"

We were there on a warm Tuesday night around 6 pm and grabbed the last of the five outside tables. The inside was bustling and loud. Every time people would open the front door we could noticed the great food smells wafting outside.
Extensive wine and craft beer menu.
We ordered the charred Brussels sprouts with tahini sauce, Parmesan cheese, panic  and shallots that were outstanding as a appetizer at $12. My entree was the fish tacos, which were good as well for $14. My companion had the smash burger, a thick beef hamburger patty cooked to perfection on a great bun.
The nits I would pick include our entrees arriving 10 minutes apart and service was slow. I will chalk that up to just getting up to speed after COVID slowdown and/or shutdowns.
We'll be back.","Written July 13, 2021"

I had the coconut shrimp, and totally enjoyed the shrimp drizzled with a delicious dressing over rice.  Every bite was amazing!   My husband enjoyed the buttery chicken curry, and said it was the best he’d ever tasted.  The Norbert is a favorite which we highly recommend.","Written July 5, 2021"

From the moment we walked in the door, we were made to feel special.  I tried the lobster mac, and it was all the reviews said it was.  My partner had the most tender filet-you could cut it with a fork; it was so tender and flavorful.  We also shared a bowl of lemon grass chicken soup, which gave us just a little hint of the quality of the food.  Believe  me, we will be back, and bring our friends.  We were told it would be a very good idea to have reservations on a Friday night, as it's very busy.","Written March 30, 2021"
